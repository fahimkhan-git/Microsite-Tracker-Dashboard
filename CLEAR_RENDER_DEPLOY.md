# üö® URGENT: Clear Deploy Command in Render Dashboard

## The Problem
Your build is **SUCCESSFUL** ‚úÖ, but Render is trying to run `npx wrangler deploy` which fails because:
1. Wrangler is for Cloudflare Workers (separate service)
2. Render doesn't need a deploy command - it just builds and starts

## The Solution: Clear it in Dashboard (REQUIRED)

The `render.yaml` deploy command **WON'T override** the dashboard setting. You **MUST** clear it manually:

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Render Dashboard
- URL: https://dashboard.render.com
- Login if needed

### 2. Select Your Service
- Click on: **microsite-tracker-backend** (or your service name)

### 3. Go to Settings
- Click the **"Settings"** tab (at the top, next to "Logs", "Metrics", etc.)

### 4. Scroll to "Build & Deploy" Section
- Scroll down to find **"Build & Deploy"** section
- Look for three fields:
  - **Build Command**
  - **Start Command**  
  - **Deploy Command** ‚Üê THIS ONE NEEDS TO BE CLEARED

### 5. Clear Deploy Command
- Find the **"Deploy Command"** field
- **Delete everything** in that field (make it completely empty/blank)
- Don't enter anything - just leave it empty

### 6. Save Changes
- Scroll to the bottom
- Click **"Save Changes"** button

### 7. Trigger Redeploy
- Go to the **"Manual Deploy"** section (or click "Deploy latest commit")
- Click **"Deploy latest commit"** to trigger a new deployment

---

## What Should Be in Dashboard

### ‚úÖ Build Command:
```
npm install && cd client && npm install && cd .. && npx prisma generate && npm run client:build
```

### ‚úÖ Start Command:
```
npm start
```

### ‚ùå Deploy Command:
```
(completely empty - no text at all)
```

---

## After Clearing - What Happens

1. ‚úÖ Build completes (you're already seeing this!)
2. ‚úÖ No deploy command runs (no wrangler error)
3. ‚úÖ Server starts with `npm start`
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible at your Render URL

---

## Why This Happens

Render's dashboard settings **override** `render.yaml` when both exist. The dashboard has `npx wrangler deploy` set manually, which takes priority.

**Important:** The `workers/` directory in your repo is for **Cloudflare Workers** (separate deployment), not for Render. Render should only:
- Build the React app
- Start the Express server
- Serve everything together

---

## Still Having Issues?

If you can't find the Deploy Command field or it's not editable:

1. **Try recreating the service:**
   - Create a new Web Service
   - Connect the same repository
   - Don't enter anything in "Deploy Command"
   - This time it should work

2. **Or contact Render support:**
   - They can remove it for you
   - Or explain if there's a different way

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Opened Render dashboard
- [ ] Selected service: `microsite-tracker-backend`
- [ ] Went to Settings tab
- [ ] Found "Build & Deploy" section
- [ ] Cleared "Deploy Command" field (made it empty)
- [ ] Clicked "Save Changes"
- [ ] Triggered new deployment
- [ ] Checked logs - should see "Build complete, starting server..." and then server starting

---

## Success Indicators

After clearing the deploy command, your logs should show:
```
‚úÖ Build command completed
‚úÖ Executing user deploy command: echo "Build complete, starting server..."
Build complete, starting server...
‚úÖ Starting service...
üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:3001
‚úÖ Service is live!
```

**NOT:**
```
‚ùå Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler deploy
```
