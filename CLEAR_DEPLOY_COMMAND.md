# 🚨 URGENT: Clear Deploy Command in Render Dashboard

## Problem
Your build is **SUCCESSFUL** ✅, but Render is trying to run `npx wrangler deploy` which fails.

**Why it fails:**
- Wrangler needs to be run from the `workers/` directory
- Render is running it from the root directory
- Cloudflare Worker should be deployed SEPARATELY, not from Render

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Clear Deploy Command in Render Dashboard

Since we removed `render.yaml`, you need to manually clear the deploy command in Render:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Click your service**: `microsite-tracker-backend`

3. **Go to Settings tab** (top navigation)

4. **Scroll to "Build & Deploy" section**

5. **Find "Deploy Command" field**

6. **DELETE everything in that field** (make it completely empty/blank)

7. **Click "Save Changes"** (bottom of page)

8. **Trigger new deployment** (click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit")

---

## ✅ What Should Be Configured:

### Build Command:
```
npm install && cd client && npm install && cd .. && npx prisma generate && npm run client:build
```

### Start Command:
```
npm start
```

### Deploy Command:
```
(COMPLETELY EMPTY - leave blank)
```

---

## After Clearing - Expected Logs:

```
✅ Build command completed
✅ Starting service with: npm start
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3001
✅ Service is live!
```

**NOT:**
```
❌ Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler deploy
```

---

## Important Notes:

- **Render** = Backend (Express server + React app)
典型案例- **Cloudflare Worker** = Tracking proxy (deploy separately with `wrangler deploy`)

These are **TWO SEPARATE DEPLOYMENTS**:
1. Render → Express backend (builds React, serves dashboard)
2. Cloudflare Worker → Tracking proxy (fast edge network)

---

## Deploy Cloudflare Worker Separately (After Render is working):

```bash
cd workers
wrangler login
wrangler secret put BACKEND_URL  # Your Render URL
wrangler deploy
```

---

**Once you clear the deploy command in Render dashboard, your deployment will succeed!** 🚀
