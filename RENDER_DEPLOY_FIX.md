# Fix: Render Deploy Command Issue

## Problem
Render is trying to run `npx wrangler deploy` after the build completes, but Wrangler is for Cloudflare Workers, not Render deployment.

## Solution

### Option 1: Remove Deploy Command in Render Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your service: `microsite-tracker-backend`
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Scroll to **Build & Deploy** section
5. **Clear/remove** the "Deploy Command" field (leave it empty)
6. Click **Save Changes**
7. Trigger a new deployment

**Render should only have:**
- ✅ Build Command: `npm install && cd client && npm install && cd .. && npx prisma generate && npm run client:build`
- ✅ Start Command: `npm start`
- ❌ Deploy Command: (empty or not set)

### Option 2: If Deploy Command Field is Required

If Render requires a deploy command field, set it to:
```
echo "Build complete, starting server..."
```

This will just print a message and let Render continue to the start command.

## Why This Happens

Render might auto-detect deploy commands from:
- `package.json` scripts (though we don't have a "deploy" script)
- Other config files
- Manual configuration in the dashboard

**Important:** The `workers/` directory is for Cloudflare Workers deployment (separate service), not for Render. Render should only build and run the Express server.

## What Should Happen

After fixing:
1. ✅ Build completes successfully (already working!)
2. ✅ Server starts with `npm start`
3. ✅ Express serves the built React app
4. ✅ Dashboard accessible at your Render URL

---

## Cloudflare Worker (Separate)

The Cloudflare Worker should be deployed separately:
1. `cd workers`
2. `wrangler login`
3. `wrangler secret put BACKEND_URL` (your Render URL)
4. `wrangler deploy`

This is independent of Render deployment.
