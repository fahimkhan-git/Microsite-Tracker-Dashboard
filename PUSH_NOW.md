# Push to GitHub Now

## Quick Steps:

### Step 1: Generate Personal Access Token

1. Open: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Microsite-Tracker-Push&scopes=repo
2. Click **"Generate token"**
3. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Push with Token

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Volumes/homesfy workspace/new-dash"
git push -u origin main
```

**When prompted:**
- Username: `fahimkhan-git`
- Password: [paste your token here]

### Alternative: Use Token in URL (one-time)

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://fahimkhan-git:[YOUR_TOKEN]@github.com/fahimkhan-git/Microsite-Tracker-Dashboard.git
git push -u origin main
```

**⚠️ Note:** This stores the token in the URL. After pushing, you can remove it:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/fahimkhan-git/Microsite-Tracker-Dashboard.git
```

## Or Use GitHub CLI (If Installed):

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Login
gh auth login
# Follow prompts to authenticate

# Push
git push -u origin main
```
